The whole study was completed online.
Every participant was sent an informed consent form and privacy policy, which was read, signed and returned by everybody.
Discord\footnote{\url{discordapp.com/} - accessed on 21th June 2020} was ised as a communication software. The participants registered as a team of two. 
Every team was added to a private discord group, which allowed screen sharing from multiple attendees.

At the start of each test, the participants received access to the game, which was downloaded on their personal computer.
Every participant shared their screen showing the game. The conference and the screen share was recorded for an analysis afterwards using OBS Studio\footnote{\url{https://obsproject.com/} - accessed on 21th June 2020}.
After both players started the game, the lobby was used to explain how the controls of the game worked, how they could interact with objects and what the goal of the game was. They were also told, that objects with the same colour would be invisible for them, and their partner would have the duty to instruct them without verbal communication.
All built-in communication tools were described and remaining gameplay-questions answered.

Each participant had to mute their microphone to prevent any verbal communications and the discord window was minimised to prevent the unintended disclosure of information by looking at the screen of the partner.
The team started the first level afterwards. All nine levels had to be absolved without a break in between.
After each team reached the goal, they were asked following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How would you rate your experience with computer games, on a scale of one to five, where five means you have a lot of experience?
    \item How would you rate your experience with cooperative computer games, on a scale of one to five, where five means you have a lot of experience?
    \item How old are you?
    \item What is the relationship to your partner?
    \item How long have you known your partner?
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, there was an open question about what they missed by using these communication tools.
The log-files of each participant were transmitted for later analysis.
Afterwards, the participation was completed.

Each log-file contained the amount of usage for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item standard pings
    \item special pings
    \item standard emotes
    \item special emotes
    \item placed decals
    \item recorded ghosts
\end{itemize}

The recorded footage was used to analyse the reason why interactions were used and how long every team needed to complete a level.
