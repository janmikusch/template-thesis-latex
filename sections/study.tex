The whole study is completed online.
Every participant is sent an informed consent form and privacy policy, which is read, signed and returned.
Discord\footnote{\url{https://discordapp.com/} - accessed on 21th June 2020} was used as a communication software for the coordination and recording of the session. The participants register as a team of two. 
Every team is added to a private discord group, which allows screen sharing from multiple attendees.

At the start of each test, the participants receive access to the game, which is downloaded on their personal computer.
Every participant shares their screen showing the game. The conference and the screen share is recorded for an analysis afterwards using OBS Studio\footnote{\url{https://obsproject.com/} - accessed on 21th June 2020}.
After both players start the game, the lobby is used to explain how the controls of the game work, how they can interact with objects and what the goal of the game is. They are also told, that objects with the same colour are invisible for them, and their partner has the duty to instruct them without verbal communication.
All built-in communication tools are described and remaining gameplay-questions are answered.

Each participant has to mute their microphone to prevent any verbal communications and the discord window is minimised to prevent any unintended disclosure of information by looking at the screen of the partner.
The team starts the first level afterwards. All nine levels have to be absolved without a break in between.
After each team reach the goal, they are asked following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How would you rate your experience with computer games, on a scale of one to five, where five means you have a lot of experience?
    \item How would you rate your experience with cooperative computer games, on a scale of one to five, where five means you have a lot of experience?
    \item How old are you?
    \item What is the relationship to your partner?
    \item How long have you known your partner?
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, there is an open question about what they missed by using these communication tools.
The log-files of each participant are transmitted for later analysis.
Afterwards, the participation is completed.

Each log-file contains the amount of usage for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item standard pings
    \item special pings
    \item standard emotes
    \item special emotes
    \item placed decals
    \item recorded ghosts
\end{itemize}

The recorded footage is used to analyse the reason why interactions are used and how long every team needs to complete a level.
