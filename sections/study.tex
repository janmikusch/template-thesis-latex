The whole study was completely done online.
Every participant was sent an informed consent and privacy policy, which was read, signed and returned by everybody.
As communication software, discord\footnote{\url{discordapp.com/} - accessed on 21th June 2020} was used. The participants registered as a team of two. 
Every team was added to a private discord group, which allowed screen sharing from multiple attendees.

At the start of each appointment, the participants got access to the game, which was downloaded on their personal computer.
Every participant shared the screen with the game. The conference and the screen share was recorded for an analysis afterwards using OBS Studio\footnote{\url{https://obsproject.com/} - accessed on 21th June 2020}.
After both players started the game, the lobby was used to explain how the controls of the game worked, how they can interact with objects and what the goal of the game is. Also they were told, that objects with the same colour will be invisible for them, and their partner will have the duty to instruct them without verbal communication.
All build-in communication tools were described and remaining gameplay-questions answered.

Each participant had to mute their microphone to prevent any verbal communications and the discord window was minimised to prevent the unintended disclosure of information by looking at the screen of the partner.
The team started the first level afterwards. All nine level had to be absolved without break in between.
After every team reached the goal, they were asked following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How would you rate your experience with computer games, on a scale of one two five, where five means you have a lot of experience?
    \item How would you rate your experience with cooperative computer games, on a scale of one two five, where five means you have a lot of experience?
    \item How old are you?
    \item What is the relationship to your partner?
    \item How long do you know your partner?
\end{enumerate}

Additionally there was an open question about what they missed by using this communication tools.
The log-files of each participant was transmitted for later analysis.
Afterwards, the participation was completed.

Each log-file contained the amount of usage for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item standard pings
    \item special pings
    \item standard emotes
    \item special emotes
    \item placed decals
    \item recorded ghosts
\end{itemize}

The recorded footage was used to analyse for what reason interactions were used and how long every team needed to complete a level.
