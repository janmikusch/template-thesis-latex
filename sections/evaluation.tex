Ten people in total participated in the study. Additionally two people participated as pre-tester, which are not included in the analysis.

The collection of all the data occurred during the time span of 14th June 2020 to 18th June 2020.

As seen in Table \ref{table:participant evaluation}, 4 participants stated to be very experienced (5) and 6 participants stated to be highly experienced (4) with computer games, but with one exception, everybody claimed their experience with cooperation games to be lower. The cooperative experience ranged from 2 to 4, with an average of 3 and a standard deviation of 0.86.
Participants had an average age of 24 years, ranging from 21 to 27.
Three teams consisted of players in an ongoing relationship between 2 and 4 years, one team stated to have been friends for 4 years, as well as one team consisting of best friends, with a relationship duration of 9 years.

\end{table}

The usage of the implemented mechanics were rather different, but every team used standard pings as their most used communication mechanic, as seen in Table \ref{table:overall interactions}. 
Standard Pings were mostly used to mark certain positions, items or to get attention. For example, players pinged onto positions where their partner should walk to, sometimes (and especially when they do something different), players also pinged on their partner first and then on the position, where they should go.
Standard pings were also used to mark moveable boxes and pressure plates, so an invisible box could be moved onto an invisible pressure plate. Team 5 and Team 2 used these pings to draw arrow-like shapes for direction advice. 
In the last level, standard pings were used to mark safe and unsafe paths, regarding the invisible traps. Team 1 combined this ping with emotes, to create their own special form of pings to differentiate safe paths (thumbs-up emoji) and unsafe paths (dead emoji).

Special pings were used by some teams, but only for certain problems. The push and pull pings were used to mark a box, but the arrows on the icon were used to symbolise, if the box should be moved to the left or to the right, but overall it seemed to be unimportant for the players, if the icon meant pull or push.
The here-ping (circle with arrow showing downwards) was used to mark positions where players should stand at or boxes should be moved to, but this strategy was used only if a player wanted to give more specific commands and when their partner seemed to be clueless about what they wanted.
Hand and eye pings where only used to mark toggles, if the player was not using standard pings for this action, but were used rather rarely.
The countdown ping was only used by two teams, as most time-based toggles were solved by using a trial and error approach, until it worked. One team used the countdown ping to sync the activation, and one team used it to mark toggles.

The implemented standard emote (exclamation mark), was used most of the time only by mistake, when they released the button too fast.
Special emotes however, had some practical effect. The two most used emotes where the thumbs up and thumbs down emojis, as they were used to communicate, if an action was done as intended, for example when the box was on top of a pressure plate or if the player missed it (which was followed by a position marking ping).
As mentioned before, dead emojis were used in combination of standard pings to mark traps, but apart from that, they were rarely used. 

The evil laughing emoji was not used very often, but was always used when a player died or their partner lured them into a trap. Players used this emoji to laugh about their partner.

When a partner was not following the intended command, two teams used the angry emoji. Every other emoji was used rarely without any predictable reason or by mistake.

Ghosts were, after standard emotes, the most unused communication mechanic. Two teams used them to draw arrow-like shapes or to draw from where to where a box should be moved to. They also were used to mark safe paths, but were replaced with decals after one to two usages.

Decals had only two usages. The first was to mark a safe position in the invisible traps level (level 9), which was a used by four teams. Three of them used different symbols, like red or blue stars, as well as circles. One team used arrows to mark a safe direction and overdrew them, if they made a mistake or found out, that this path was not secure.
The second usage was to place decals on the positions of pressure plates, especially in level 8. This was done by three teams. All three used blue star decals to mark blue pressure plates and red stars to mark red pressure plates. The exclamation decal was never used with intention, and except for one team, nobody used arrows. The most used decals were red/blue stars and the ring decal.
