Ten persons in total were recruited for the study, additional to two persons who participated the study as pre-tester, which however will not be included.

The collection of all data occurred during a time span from 14th June 2020 to 18thth June 2020.

As seen in Table \ref{table:participant evaluation}, 4 participants stated to be very experienced (5) and 6 participants stated to be high experienced (4) with computer games, but with one exception, everybody claimed their experience with cooperation games to be lower. The cooperative experience ranged from 2 to 4, with an average of 3 and an standard deviation of 0.86.
Participants had an average age of 24 years, ranging from 27 to 21.
Three teams were players in an ongoing relationship between 2 and 4 years, one team stated to be friends for 4 years, as well as one team consisting of best friends, with an relationship duration of 9 years.

\end{table}

The usage of the implemented mechanics were rather different, but every team was using standard pings as their most used communication mechanic, as seen in Table \ref{table:overall interactions}. 
Standard Pings were mostly used to mark certain positions, items or to get attention. For example, players pinged onto positions where their partner should walk to, sometimes (and especially when they do something different), players also ping at their partner first and then on the position, where they should go to.
Standard pings were also used to mark moveable boxes and pressure plates, so an invisible box was moved onto an invisible pressure plate. Team 5 and Team 2 used these pings to draw arrow-like shapes for direction advice. 
In the last level, standard pings were used to mark save and unsave paths, regarding the invisible traps. Team 1 combined this ping with emotes, to create their own special form of pings to differentiate save paths (thumbs-up emoji) and unsafe paths (dead emoji).

Special pings were used from some teams, but only for certain problems. The push and pull pings were used to mark a box, but the arrows on the icon were used to symbolise, if the box should be moved to the left or to the right, but overall it seemed to be unimportant for the players, if the icon meant pull or push.
The here-ping (circle with arrow showing downwards) was used to mark positions where players should stand at or boxes should be moved to, but this stategy was used only if a player wanted to give more specific commands and when their partner seemed to be clueless about what they want.
Hand and eye pings where only used to mark toggles, if the player was not using standard pings for this action, but were rather rarely used.
The countdown ping was only used by two teams, as most time-based toggles were solved by using a try and error approach, until it worked. One team used the countdown ping to sync the activation, and one team used it to mark toggles.

The implemented standard emote (exclamation mark), was used most of the time only by mistake, when they released the button too fast.
Special emotes however, had some practical effect. The two most used emotes where the thumb's up and thumb's down emojis, as they were used to communicate, if an action was done as intended for example when the box was on top of a pressure plate or if the player missed it (which was followed by a position marking ping).
As mentioned before, dead emojis were used in combination of standard pings to mark traps, but apart from that, rarely used. Even though the evil laughing emoji was not used very often, the usage had nearly always the same reason: when a player died or their partner lured them into a trap, players used this emoji to laugh about their partner. When a partner was not following the intended command, two teams used the angry emoji. Every other emoji was rarely used with any predictable reason or by mistake.

Ghosts were, after standard emotes, the most unused communication mechanic. Two teams used them to draw arrow-like shapes or to draw from where to where a box should be moved to. Also they were used to mark save paths, but were replaced with decals after one to two usages.

Decals had only two usages. The first was to mark a save position in the invisible traps level (level 9), which was a used by four teams. Three of them were using different symbols, like red or blue stars, as well as circles. One team used arrows to mark a save direction and overdraw them, if they made a mistake or found out, that this path was not secure.
The second usage was to place decals on the positions of pressure plates, especially in level 8. This was done by three teams. All three used blue star decals to mark blue pressure plates and red stars to mark red pressure plates. The exclamation decal was never used with intention, and besides one team, nobody used arrows. The most used decals were red/blue stars and the ring decal.
