In this study, I analysed how non-verbal communication mechanics could be implemented in a small cooperative puzzle game. Furthermore, the study showed, how these implemented mechanic were used by the participants.

With this study, no causal relation between the duration or the type of relationship could be found. 
A study with a higher amount of participants could show better results regarding this.
Also, a higher variety of experienced players could show more different usages of the implemented mechanics, as well show how often these are needed. 
As every player had a lot of experience, inexperienced players may handle the communication different, therefore a study with more participants having different skill-levels would be a topic for the future.

However, the study proved, that it is possible to communicate in new virtual worlds, without any arrangements concerning the usage of how the tools are used. Nevertheless, it also showed that a missing common ground and not having the possibility to build up a common ground, a lot of misinterpretation occurred during the communication.
\textcite{Vaddi2016Investigating2}[46] stated that the performance of teams using a combination of voice and mechanics were significantly faster, which could be related of having the possibility to negotiate tactics and usage of tools and therefore building up their common ground.

Besides the misinterpretation, three teams also stated that they were missing the possibility to show, that they had no clue what to do, and what the other player meant. For that reason, they would like to have a question mark or thinking-emoji to signal their partner about their concerns.
Another thing three teams mentioned, are the possibility to cancel interactions. One a button was clicked, there was no way to cancel, whereby unwanted communication actions were influencing the study with unwanted and unnecessary interactions. They also stated, that not having a possibility to cancel the mechanic, was annoying to them, especially when they were confusing the key-binding to the wanted tool.

When these methods are implemented in a real game, it also have to be considered, which different options players should have. Some options of emojis and decals were simple not used, as well as the pull & pushed ping could have been combined into a single option. As too many choices can slow down the search for a specific option, as stated by two participants, having more play-tests to find the optimal amount of choices is highly recommended.
