First, a theoretical part will show the possibilities of communication and how they can be
used in cooperative games. 

Tang et al. (2012)[581] investigated the verbal coordination in first person shooter (FPS) games.
Because FPS games have a fast gameplay the conversations with team members needs to be
brief, most call-outs are having 8 words or fewer and for other players unknown information
is provided as fast as possible (Tang et al. 2012)[581]. While synchronous verbal communication
via voice or text chat is common for online games, either directly or through an external
program, rich alternate channels for communication to teammates exist. These in-game systems
enable players to direct attention and provide information in ways that are difficult or
impossible verbally (Toups et al. 2014)[257]. Next to verbal communication Jean Macmillan
(2004)[61] says that the team structure and allocation for tasks responsibilities has an impact
on team performance. Team coordination can be separated into explicit and implicit coordination,
where explicit means that the coordination requires the team members to communicate
to articulate their plans (Jean Macmillan 2004)[61]. Implicit coordination describes the ability
of team members to act in concert without the need for overt communication (Jean Macmillan2004)[61].
