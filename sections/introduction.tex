Morschheuser et al. (2017)[169] said that cooperation is an anchor of our society and a key
ability of people, who are working, studying, and carrying out most leisure activities together
to achieve shared goals. Jean Macmillan (2004)[61] said that the team must have shared information
about the situation and the other team members to achieve common goals. Communication
is required to share those information, so the whole team knows the situation and
how they should act (Jean Macmillan 2004)[61]. With the cooperation of individuals, goals can
be achieved much faster and better. Cooperative computer games have shown that cooperation
in computer-games emerges effortlessly (Morschheuser et al. 2017)[169]. Zagal, Rick, and Hsi
(2006)[24] found out that many cooperative game mechanisms in games were developed. Some
though do not always result in players collaborating to play the game. Even though a system
is made to entice people to play as teams and lead, many are still just doing their own thing
(Zagal, Rick, and Hsi 2006)[24].
