Cooperation is an anchor of our society and a key ability of people who are working, studying and carrying out most leisure activities together to achieve shared goals \autocite{Morschheuser2017HowGame}[169]. A key part of cooperation is communication. To work together, a team has to share information to work towards a common goal.
Cooperative multiplayer computer games have, apart from some exceptions, always a goal, a team is working to achieve, which can be to accomplish a high score, complete a level, win against an enemy team and so on.

The aim of this thesis is to show, how players will interact within a cooperative puzzle game without the possibility to communicate using their voice, in an unfamiliar environment and how non-verbal communication forms can be implemented. 
To provide an unfamiliar game players have never played before, a self-made cooperative puzzle game is created. It implements different non-verbal communication mechanics, enabling players to communicate during play.

Section \ref{section:Communication} shows, how communication is used in computer games, as well what is necessary to share information successfully. Verbal and non-verbal communication forms are described and how common ground influences communication, as well as the meaning of embodiment in games.
Afterwards, the influence and reason of game mechanics for in-game communication is discussed. Additionally, the framework of \textcite{Toups2014ATheory}, which divides cooperative game mechanics into six different types, is described.

In the implementation section \ref{section:Implementation}, the game idea, as well as all game elements are explained. 
The implementation of four cooperative game mechanic types are explained as well. Besides an attention-focusing ping mechanic, an expressive mechanic in form of emojis, environment-modifying decals and the recording of the player position are implemented.
After the theoretical part of the implementation is explained, the following sections describe, how each game element and all communication mechanics are implemented, using Unity as a game engine, together with Photon as a network-multiplayer framework.

The procedure of the study, followed by the study results, shows how players are using the provided communication mechanics. The whole study is done online, without physical contact to and between the participants.
